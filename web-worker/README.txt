ðŸ“Œ What is a Web Worker?
A Web Worker is a background thread in a browser that allows JavaScript code 
to be executed outside of the main UI thread so as not to slow down the interface.

âœ… Why use it?
For heavy computations (e.g., big data processing, cryptography)
For non-blocking logic so that the interface does not freeze
To improve responsiveness and UX

ðŸš« What is not allowed in workers?
No access to DOM (document, window)
Alert, confirm, and prompt cannot be used
No localStorage, but IndexedDB is available
Cannot work directly with HTML
